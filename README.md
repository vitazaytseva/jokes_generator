# Russian Jokes Generator

## Description
This project is a joke generator, that is a special case of text generation.
```
Input: a collection of jokes.  
Output: generated text based on the input collection.
```
The program is trained on two models, which are based on the same architecture — RuGPT3. 
Before starting generation it is possible to select a model, a topic of jokes (if it is a ‘Наша’ model) 
and the length of the generated text. Besides, you need to enter a prompt for a joke 
and the program will continue the text.

## Focal points
### Contents
The generator consists of the following folders:
1. `models_config`  
   

   Two models are stored here. Both are based on the same architecture — RuGPT3. 
   The difference between them is fine-tuning on different datasets.
   Our model was fine-tuned on a collection of texts from [humornet.ru](https://humornet.ru).
   As for the other model, we are giving credits to [Neural Shit](https://t.me/NeuralShit).
   

2. `spider`
   

   Here you can find scraper for collecting dataset from the site [humornet.ru](https://humornet.ru)


3. `src`
   

   It is the folder where the GUI, the model request and the saving the history of jokes are stored.
   

4. `tests` 
   

   Here you can find unit tests on models.

## Running
### Program launch
Before starting check that you have installed all the required modules. 
If not, open the console and write the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now you are ready to start!  
To run the generator you need to open the file `main.py` in the folder `src` and run the method:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = Application()
    app.run
```

### Interface
When you start the generator, the Joke Generator front-end application will open. 
At the bottom you can see 2 drop-down lists: `model` and `length`. 
You can choose "Чужая" or "Наша" model. If you select "Наша" model, you can select a `tag` or, in other words, 
a topic of the future generated joke. There are 10 themes to choose from:
1. Food
2. Politics
3. Cats
4. Vulgar
5. Job
6. Computers
7. Children
8. Stirlitz
9. Students
10. Neighbours

Besides, you can choose the `length` of the generated joke from 30 to 100 characters.

Above the drop-down lists there is a field where you can write the prompt for a joke. 
To the right of this field there is a button "Отправить". After clicking on it or pressing Enter, 
in the window above you can see your prompt and after a while the generated anecdote itself.

### Running
To get the generated joke, you need to enter a prompt for a joke in the field, select all categories and 
click on "Отправить" or press Enter. Then your prompt and the generated joke will appear.


### Saving
Our program has an automatic function of saving jokes locally. 
When you run the generator for the first time, the file `jokes_history.txt` is created, 
where you can see all the generated jokes.
